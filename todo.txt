RATE LIMITING USER LOGIN
Rate Limiting: Protect the refresh endpoint with rate-limiting to prevent brute force attacks on refresh tokens.
Token Revocation: Detect token compromise or logout event.
                Mark the refresh token as revoked or delete it from the database.
                Ensure the revoked token cannot be used to generate new tokens.
